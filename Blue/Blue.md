Hello everyone, In this blog we are going to solve Blue from HackTheBox.

Link for the machine : [https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/51](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/51)

  

Lets Start ðŸ™Œ

  

Connect to the HTB server by using the OpenVpn configuration file thatâ€™s generated by HTB.

[ [Click Here](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5185687-introduction-to-lab-access) to learn more about how to connect to vpn and access the boxes. ]

After connecting to the vpn service, click on Join Machine to access the machineâ€™s ip.

After joining the machine you can see the IP Address of the target machine.

  

First I started by scanning for open ports on the target machine.

From the scan results, I found the following service: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP). I google about this service and got this: [https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/)

I opened metasploit and run the above mentioned exploit:

The attack was successful and I got the meterpreter shell back. Now its time to find the flags.

Found the user flag at `C:\Users\haris\Desktop\user.txt`

![[Blue/assets/Untitled 5.png|Untitled 5.png]]

Found the user flag at `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt`

![[Blue/assets/Untitled 6.png|Untitled 6.png]]

We have successfully obtained all the flags.

  

Thank You!!!!
