In this writeup we are going to solve the SQHell room from TryHackMe.

Link to the Room : [https://tryhackme.com/room/sqhell](https://tryhackme.com/room/sqhell)

  

This room is completely based on SQL Injections. You can refer this link: `[https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection)` to know more about what is SQL Injection and also to learn more SQL Techniques.

  

Let‚Äôs Start üôå

  

First Start the machine and wait for 1 minute for the machine to boot up completely. After 5 minutes visit the given website.

The given website is blog site, with two posts posted by the admin. There are options to login and register. When I tried to register, the website responded back that ‚ÄúRegistrations are no longer open‚Äù.

So I moved on to the login page. I tried to check the entry points ( username and password fields ) whether they are vulnerable to SQL Injection by brute-forcing the entry points using the logical operations given in the word-list below.

I used the community edition of burp-suite to brute-force. I first captured the login request with random credentials and then send it to intruder to brute-force with sniper attack.

First I brute-forced the username field. But it didn‚Äôt provide me with any great results.

Then I tried to brute-force the password field to check whether it is vulnerable to sql injection with the same method and it worked for the logical operation: `1'oR'1'='1`. So I tried to verify that using the Burp repeater.

And we got our first flag.

Now we can move on to the second flag. For the second flag the hint was to check the terms and conditions.

In the Terms and Conditions, its mentioned that ‚ÄúWe log your IP address for analytics purposes‚Äù.

  

The I tried to enumerate the directories in the website using gobuster.

Command: `gobuster dir -u <targetURL> -w <wordlist>`

I found the other pages `/user` and `/post`
